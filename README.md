## Project Overview 🎯

This project primarily focuses on three main aspects:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing CloudSat data for analysis
2. **Regression Models**: Building predictive models using Ridge Regression and XGBoost
3. **Evaluation and Visualization**: Assessing model performance with comprehensive visualizations

## Usage 📝

### Data Preprocessing
```python
python muqy_20241030_data_prep_ridge_regression_grid.py
```

### Ridge Regression Analysis
