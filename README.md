# ☁️ ML Analysis of Cirrus-Meteorology Relationships

Welcome to the ML-based Cirrus Cloud Analysis project! 🚀

This project focuses on understanding and predicting cirrus cloud formation and properties through their relationships with meteorological conditions using machine learning techniques. By combining CloudSat-CALIPSO observations with meteorological data, we aim to uncover the complex interactions between cirrus clouds and atmospheric conditions.

## Project Overview 🎯

This project primarily investigates three key aspects of cirrus-meteorology relationships:

1. **Data Integration**: Combining CloudSat-CALIPSO cirrus observations with meteorological parameters
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Applying Ridge Regression and XGBoost to understand cirrus-meteorology relationships
3. **Analysis and Visualization**: Quantifying the relationships between cirrus properties and meteorological conditions

## Usage 📝

### Data Preprocessing
```python
python muqy_20241030_data_prep_ridge_regression_grid.py
```

### Ridge Regression Analysis
```python
python muqy_20241024_ridge_regression_test.py
```

### XGBoost Model Testing
```python
python muqy_20241028_XGBoost_test.py
```

> **Tip**: Before running the scripts, ensure you have configured the appropriate data paths and parameters.
